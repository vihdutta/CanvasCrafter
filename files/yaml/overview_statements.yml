# weekly overview statements organized by each week

weekly_overview:
  - week: 1
    description: >
      Welcome to Winter 2025 ME 240! This week, we will start by familiarizing ourselves with the syllabus, including the course structure and expectations.
      We will start Module 1, which introduces the principles of Particle Kinematics.
      Please complete the Student Survey from FCI by 1/15/2025 for the chance to earn extra credit on the overall assignments score in the course.

  - week: 2
    description: >
      This week we will continue to explore Particle Kinematics as we introduce two new coordinate systems: Normal-Tangential and Polar/Cylindrical.
      By the end of the week, we will see the applications of these tools as we begin to introduce particle kinetics.
      Our first homework will be due at the end of this week—use the drop-in hours if you have any questions.

  - week: 3
    description: >
      We will continue our exploration of Particle Kinetics.
      Our first Checkout will be at the end of this week, with class time on Wednesday reserved for group work on the problem.
      Please coordinate with your groups ahead of time.

  - week: 4
    description: >
      We continue Particle Kinetics and will work on computational simulation methods for equations of motion.
      Bring a computer with MATLAB installed on Friday.
      Quiz 1 is on Wednesday—see the linked assessment info.

  - week: 5
    description: >
      This week we will expand our knowledge by deriving work-energy solving methods for two-state kinetics problems.
      Checkout 2 will be conducted during class at the end of the week.

  - week: 6
    description: >
      Final week of Particle Kinetics. We’ll explore impulse-momentum methods for solving two-state problems.
      Quiz 2 will take place midweek.

  - week: 7
    description: >
      We’ll focus on vibrations of particles—starting with undamped and moving to damped.
      The week concludes with discussions on linearization and simulation of vibratory systems.

  - week: 8
    description: >
      This is a major transition week—we begin rigid body analysis, which forms the crux of the course.
      We will introduce rigid body kinematics and build upon it in the coming weeks.

  - week: 9
    description: >
      Enjoy your break! Upon return, we’ll continue rigid body kinematics.

  - week: 10
    description: >
      Continue rigid body kinematics by investigating instantaneous centers of zero velocity
      and deriving acceleration equations for general motion.

  - week: 11
    description: >
      This week we wrap up rigid body kinematics with motion relative to rotating axes.
      Module 4 Checkout happens at the end of the week.

  - week: 12
    description: >
      Begin rigid body kinetics—analyzing how forces affect both translation and rotation of rigid bodies.
      We’ll incorporate both Newton’s and Euler’s equations.

  - week: 13
    description: >
      We’ll explore real-world examples and applications in rigid body kinetics.
      A special design case study wraps up the week.

  - week: 14
    description: >
      Final week of rigid body kinetics, covering work-energy methods for two-state problems.
      We will account for both translational and rotational kinetic energy.
      Final Checkout takes place at the end of the week.

  - week: 15
    description: >
      Focus on vibrations of rigid bodies and forced vibrations.
      The final quiz is on Wednesday as we conclude Module 5.

  - week: 16
    description: >
      Final week of the term!
      Monday’s class will recap Module 6 and wrap up the course.
      Good luck on finals and enjoy your break!
